Sitting involves aligning the torso at approximately a 90-degree angle to the hips, while the hips and knees flex to about 90 degrees, distributing the body's weight across the sitting surface to minimize pressure points, and requiring an average of 0 to 1 MET (Metabolic Equivalent of Task), indicating very low physical activity.
