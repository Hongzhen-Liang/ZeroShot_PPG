Walking is characterized by a forward motion where one foot is in contact with the ground at all times, with each step involving a stride length of about 0.5 to 0.75 meters, at speeds varying from 3 to 4 miles per hour (about 5 to 6.4 kilometers per hour) on average, representing a moderate physical activity level of approximately 3 to 6 METs (Metabolic Equivalent of Task), depending on pace and terrain.
