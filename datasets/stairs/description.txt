Ascending stairs involves a repetitive motion where each step requires lifting the body's weight against gravity, typically over a vertical height of about 17 to 20 cm per step, translating into a high-intensity activity with an energy expenditure of approximately 4 to 9 METs (Metabolic Equivalent of Task), depending on the speed and individual's fitness level, making it a vigorous physical activity that significantly engages the leg muscles and cardiovascular system.
